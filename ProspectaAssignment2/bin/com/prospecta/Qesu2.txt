Question :  Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.

A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3

This can be represented in an excel sheet below:

A B C

1 5 3 =5+A1

2 7 8 =A2+B2

3 9 =4+5 =C2+B3

I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output
with the results. If it is a value, then return a value. If it is a formula then
 calculate the formula and return the value of that formula



 Question 1 :  How will you tackle the challenge above?

 Ans :  Firstly I will take input with use of scanner .
 -> Then  I will Split the String where there are "," 
 -> Now I will create a LinkedHashMap to store the key-value pairs Key will be the cell and the value will be the value contained in the cell
 -> Now I will take each String from the split array then I again split the string with ':';
 -> The first value will be my cell and the second string will be my mathematical value or expression which will be in map in the hash map
 -> Then I will check the the cell is valid or not also the value is num or not if this fails  then I will return invalid input.
 -> Now will get all entries in the hash map in a set and Iterate over the map I will again go further and break the problem I will separate the entries which the mathematical expression and value which have an integer value will be mapped in another hash map string a key and integer key and remove it from the current hash map 
 -> Entries that have mathematical expressions will be solved so I will go to one entry and solve that if I get a cell that is yet to be calculated then I will calculate that with DFS if I get a cell that is empty then that will be an exception cause there is no value

As the value will be calculate I will remove it from the hash map and add it another answer hash map 
If all is gone well then all the key-value pairs will be stored in CSV file
Input of csv file is 
A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3
Output of csv file is 
A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: 9, C1: 10, C2: 15, C3: =24

Question 2 :  What type of errors you would you check for?

Ans- NAN error can be occurs.
    Arithmetic Exception.
    Bad operand 
    Number format
    Valid cell
    Valid Expression


Question 3 : How might a user break your code?

 Ans : By passing first word as a integer which is irrelevant type of data
there might be chance of circular dependency error because in the formula A is dependent on C and C is dependent on A .
