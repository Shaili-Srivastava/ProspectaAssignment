Question =>  Question: what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure
             that it is secure and reliable?


Answer :   There are few key point which you should follow when we are creating or consuming a api like this:-


1. Authentication  Any of our application should has the feature of authentication for the the purpose of
                        accessing our APIs by the user.


2. Authorization This is also important feature which should be there in any web-services. No one who is not
                     authorized person should not have access to changing any data form database.


3. Validation It is also a important thing which will allow to user to fill the data for posting according
                  our validations of APIs.


 4. Encryption  So this is a important part of a application that means all the sensitive data should be
                   encrypted inside our application.
